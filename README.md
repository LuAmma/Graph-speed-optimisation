# Graph speed optimisation
 This short script serves as example on how Graphs can be used to solve problems. A given track is transfered into a Graph of possible car maneuvers to pass through. In the Path with the lowest cost (needed time and fuel) gets chosen.

## Running the Code
The easiest way to run the code is Binder. Open the following link:

The libaries might need some time to download.

## Input
A track is configured by inserting the maximal speed for each part of the track into the track_conig.csv file
